Hello there! Our project was to create a html page that could demonstrate multiple uses of vue elements, graphs, and visual mediums, for our cs 5820 class, at Utah state university. 

The following site can be seen at 
https://robinusu.github.io

It's quite a impressive site and i encourage you to check it out  yourself with your own eyes! 

For this project, We developed:
o The ability to filter Magic the gathering cards based on their colors, types, card text, mana cost, and names. 
o A list of cards matching the filter options.
o Clicking or hovering over a row of the table pulls up the card up so that it can be seen in detail in the detail section. 
o The detail section shows relevant information about the card, such as Name, Types, Cost, Power and Toughness, Set Information, Effects, and Flavor Text as applicable.
